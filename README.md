NStackSDK is the companion software development kit to the [NStack](https://nstack.io) backend.

## What is NStack?

NStack provides multiple features to help facilitate an iOS application. It makes use of NStack configuration APIs to make helpful configuration features available to your application. 
For a full list of features available, see below.

## üìù Requirements

* iOS 8.0+ / tvOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.10+ / watchOS 2.0+
* Swift 3.0+

## üì¶ Installation

### Carthage
~~~
# Swift 5
github "nstack-io/nstack-ios-sdk" ~> 3.0

# Swift 4.2-5 using Alamofire 5 - Pre-release
github "nstack-io/nstack-ios-sdk" "feature/alamofire5"

# Swift 3-4
github "nstack-io/nstack-ios-sdk" ~> 2.0

# Swift 2.3
github "nstack-io/nstack-ios-sdk" == 0.3.12

# Swift 2.2
github "nstack-io/nstack-ios-sdk" == 0.3.10
~~~
### TranslationManager

Note; to make use of the Localizable feature of Nstack you will also need the TranslationManager dependency added to your cartfile.
~~~
# Swift 5
github "nodes-ios/TranslationManager"
~~~

### Migration Swift 4.x -> Swift 5

1. Put this line in the cartfile
~~~
github "nodes-ios/NStackSDK" ~> 3.0
~~~
2. Remove all other references to Alamofire and Serpent from the Cartfile
3. run ```carthage update NStackSDK``` for your platform

### Migration to NStackSDK with Alamofire 5
1. Put this line in the Cartfile
~~~
github "nodes-ios/NStackSDK" "feature/alamofire5"
~~~
2. Remove all other references to Alamofire and Serpent from the Cartfile
3. Make sure you don't have other dependencies using Alamofire 4 or Serpent ~> 1.0. If you have, refer to the github repo for the dependency for migration pointers
3. run ```carthage update NStackSDK``` for your platform

## üíª Usage

> **NOTE:** Don't forget to `import NStackSDK` in the top of the file.

### Getting Started

#### Plist

In your AppDelegate's `didFinishLaunching:` function start NStack by running:

~~~swift
let configuration = Configuration(plistName: "NStack", environment: .debug, translationsClass: Translations.self)
NStack.start(configuration: configuration, launchOptions: launchOptions)
~~~

The environment enum property passed should be that matching your projects environement. These enums are declared within the NStackSDK.
You should have a file called NStack.plist in your application bundle. It needs to contain a key called **`REST_API_KEY`** and a key called **`APPLICATION_ID`**.
The TranslationsClass passed should be the class generated by the NStack Translations Generator (see below).


#### Manually

> TODO: Docs

## Features

### Translations

Please make sure you have added the TranslationManager for this feature (see above).

To use nstack for translations, you need to install the [nstack translations generator](https://github.com/nodes-ios/nstack-translations-generator). After that, all translations will be available through the tr-variable. Example: `tr.login.forgotPassword` where `login` is the section and `forgotPassword` is the key from nstack. For example:
~~~~swift
@IBOutlet weak var forgotPasswordButton: UIButton! {
    didSet {
        forgotPasswordButton.setTitle(tr.login.forgotPassword, for: .normal)
    }
}
~~~~

With the latest 4.0 release, comes other ways of assigning translations within your project...
~~~~swift
label1.text = tr.defaultSection.successKey
----
label2.localize(for: "default.successKey")
----
label3.localize(for: skt.defaultSection.successKey)
----
label4 <=> "default.successKey"
----
label5 <=> skt.defaultSection.successKey
----
@IBOutlet @NSLocalizable("default.successKey") var label6: UILabel!
----
@IBOutlet @NSLocalizable(skt.defaultSection.successKey) var label7: UILabel!
~~~~


### Updates

Nstack can also show alerts if there is a new app update available. This will check the current version of your application against a value entered in the NStack CMS and show 
an update alert that can either force the user to update app or just reccommend it. 

To set this, you can set it as a property on your NStack configuration on initalisation. Like so...
~~~~swift
config.updateOptions = [.onStart]
~~~~
It takes an array of enum values, the values you can pass are; `.onStart`, `.onDidBecomeActive` & `.never`.
The NStackSDK has the values `[.onStart, .onDidBecomeActive]` set by default. To turn this feature off, set the value to `[.never]`.


> **NOTE:** This feature is not yet supported on macOS and watchOS.

### Messages

Ability to show custom messages to users, for example warning them about server outage. These will show as Alerts and no further configuration is required to support these.

> **NOTE:** This feature is not yet supported on macOS and watchOS.

### Rate Reminder

Alerts to remind the user to rate the application. These will show as Alerts and no further configuration is required to support these.

> **NOTE:** This feature is not yet supported on macOS and watchOS.

### Geography

NStack supports a list of geographical features. You can get and store list of countries, continents, langunages and timezones of the world, getting timezone for (lat, lng) coordinate and getting geographical information based on the requestee's ip address. For example:
~~~~swift
NStack.sharedInstance.timezone(lat: 12.0, lng: 55.0) { (timezone, error) in
    if let timezone = timezone {
        print("(12.0,55.0) is in timezone \(timezone.name)")
    }
}
~~~~

### Content responses

If you want to make a quick read API you can use NStacks Content Response feature. If you created a content response in the NStack web console fetch the data in the app as:
~~~~swift
NStack.sharedInstance.getContentResponse(60) { (response, error) in
    if let _ = response {
        //You have the content response
    }
}
~~~~

### Validation

NStack makes it possible to validate the syntax and domain of an email, just use:
~~~~swift
NStack.sharedInstance.validateEmail("tech@nodes.dk") { (valid, error) in
    if valid {
        //Email syntax and domain is valid
    }
}
~~~~
